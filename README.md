# BU_API_Project
## About the Project 
This is the first mini project. The goal of this Project was to use the Twitter API, the FFMPEG API and the Google Vision API.

# How To Run
1) cd into the directory you downloaded the files to. 
2) Update the "twitter_globals_secret.py" file with your own credentials.
3) Update the JSON path in Main.py to point to your Google API credentials.
4) Run: "python Main.py" or "pyhton3 Main.py"

The program will ask for a Twitter handle. It will fetch the images and store them in ./img/<twitter_handle>.
Then it will concatenate then images into a video. 
It will atempt to analyze the video. If it does a file video_descriptions.txt will be in the ./img/<twitter_handle> directory.
If it cannot process the video it will try and annotate each image. Those results will be in image_descriptions.txt, also in the ./img/<twitter_handle> directory.

# Setup
## Python 3
You need to run the program with Python 3. My OS is MAC OS 10.13.6, and it natively has Python 2.8 installed. I installed Python 3 separately (see: https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once that is installed you need to install the APIs

## Needed accounts
You will need a Twitter developer account and a Consumer Key and Secret, and an Access Token and Secret. I have not provided those as it would compromise my information. 

Once you have the keys you can replace empty place holders in "twitter_globals_secret.py" with your valid values.

You will need a Google Developer account. You need to enable The Cloud Vision API and the Video Intelligence API. You need to set up billing for this to work. Download the JSON credentials.
